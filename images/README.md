# Profile Photo

Please place your profile photo in this folder with the name `profile-photo.jpg`.

For best results:
- Use a high-quality image (at least 600x600 pixels)
- Use JPG format
- The image will be displayed as a circle, so a square photo works best
- Center your face in the image

Example:
```
profile-photo.jpg
```

After placing your photo in this folder, it will automatically appear on your homepage.
