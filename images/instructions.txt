INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PHOTO:

1. Place your profile photo in this folder (c:\GAGAN\portfolio\images\)
2. Rename your photo to "profile-photo.jpg"
3. For best results, use a square image (e.g., 600x600 pixels) in JPG format
4. Your photo will automatically appear on the homepage in the glass circle

If you want to use a different format (like PNG), you'll need to update the src attribute in index.html:
- For PNG: src="images/profile-photo.png"
- For GIF: src="images/profile-photo.gif"

The current placeholder uses a data URL, which will be automatically replaced when you add your actual photo.
